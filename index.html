    <h3 class="title">Testimonials from our adventurers:</h3>
    <hr>

    <p class="quote">Keep close to Nature's heart... and break clear away, once in awhile, and climb a mountain or spend a week in the woods. Wash your spirit clean.</p>
    <p class="author">- John Muir</p>
    <p class="quote">A canoe trip through the great forests, a trip with a pack-train among the mountains, a trip on snow-shoes through the silent, mysterious fairy-land of the woods in winter--each has its peculiar charm.</p>
    <p class="author">- Theodore Roosevelt</p>
    <p class="quote">Despite all I have seen and experienced, I still get the same simple thrill out of glimpsing a tiny patch of snow in a high mountain gully and feel the same urge to climb towards it.</p>
    <p class="author">- Edmund Hillary</p>
